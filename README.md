A Web Development and Digital Marketing Agency Portfolio. \
Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap library.


## The Challenge
***
The author is interested on launching a Web Development and Digital Marketing Agency. For this purpose, it is requiered to have a Portfolio website where the best example projects are shown.

The portfolio will integrate the following development best practices and characteristics:
- [x] Design and develop with the Mobile-First approach.
- [x] Apply Responsive Layout and images, for larger screen sizes.
- [x] Utilize Bootstrap Components and Grid System.
- [x] Use of Semantic HTML.
- [x] Confirm valid HTML with an external validation service.

Additional requirements:

- [x] GitHub repository with README describing the project
- [x] Navbar consistent on each page.
- [x] Navbar on each page must contain links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.
- [x] All links must work.
- [ ] Must contain your personalized information. (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.)

Note. The last point was adjusted considering this project is for a company portfolio instead of a personal web developer portfolio.

## The  development process

In order to accomplish the challenge, the following steps were executed:
- Define the purpose and plan the general idea of the site.
- Sketch the pages and main sections, considering two stages:
  - Mobile-first approach.
  - Responsive design for larger screen sizes.
- Create the base-line layout and grid.
- Search for assets (images, icons, logo, etc.)
- Integrate assets to the layout.
- Add basic functionality like links, navigation bar and dropdown group.
- Add minimum CSS adjustments.
- Apply semantic HTML.
- Asses valid HTML.
- Final review and proper documentation.
